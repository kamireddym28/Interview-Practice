## Qusestion 1:

**1.	What is the most influential book or blog post you’ve read regarding web development?**

Earlier when I started with web development, as a part of self-learning, I found this website called _w3schools.com_ very much helpful to understand basic concepts. This website provides an opportunity to gain hands on experience while learning which influenced me to dig deep into the topics of web development. 

In recent times, I started following _David Walsh’s_ blog interesting as it show cases all the latest advancement in web development.
